simulate_vivax_interventions(
  df,
  intervention_list,
  previous_simulation = NULL,
  f = 1/72,
  gamma = 1/223,
  r = 1/60,

\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing the data, with one column called I containing the proportion
of infectious individuals (I0+Il) at equilibrium, one column called lambda containing the transmission rate,
and one variable called id which identifies uniquely each row in the dataset.
Additional optional variables are: \cr
rho (reporting rate), delta (importation rate) \cr
intervention levels in the past (when lambda was calculated):  alpha.old (effective care), beta.old (proportion of liver stage cure), omega.old (intensity of vector control)
intervention levels in the future (in the simulation):  alpha.new (effective care), beta.new (proportion of liver stage cure), omega.new (intensity of vector control)
In practice, this dataframe can be the output of the function calculate_r0_rc_fromdata}

\item{intervention_list}{a list of intervention objects.}

\item{previous_simulation}{the result of a previous simulation (e.g. the outcome of simulate_vivax_interventions or chain_vivax_interventions).
If NULL (default), the model is simulated from equilibrium}

\item{f}{relapse frequency}

\item{gamma}{liver clearance rate}

\item{r}{blood clearance rate}

\item{year}{if TRUE, aggregates the outputs per year (h would be in cases per person year). if FALSE, returns daily outputs (h would be in cases per person day).}

\item{maxtime}{number of time steps for simulation}

\item{delay}{a boolean indicating if the model including delays in treatment should be used. Default (FALSE) is the model without delay in treatment}

\item{rcd}{a boolean indicating if the model including reactive case detection should be used. Default (FALSE) is the model without RCD}

\item{referral}{a boolean indicating if the rcd model includes referral. Default (FALSE) is the model with referral for RCD. This parameter is used only if rcd==TRUE.}

\item{mda}{a boolean indicating if the model including mass drug administration (MDA) prophylaxis should be used. Default (FALSE) is the model without MDA}

\item{rcd_at_baseline}{a boolean indicating if the model was calibrated using the RCD model (i.e. there is some RCD at baseline already). Default (FALSE) is the model without RCD at baseline}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the simulated state variables for each parameter combination in df
}
\description{
Uses the compartmental model to simulate the effect of interventions
}
\details{
An intervention object is named list containing the intervention description. It should have the follwing structure:
list(intervention_name="string", "alpha.new"=NA, "beta.new"=NA, "omega.new"=NA, "rho.new"=NA )
where NA can be replaced by scalars or kepts as such.
If alpha.new is not provided in intervention_object it is equal to alpha.
If beta.new is not provided in intervention_object it is equal to beta.
If omega.new is not provided in intervention_object it is equal to omega.
If rho.new is not provided in intervention_object it is equal to rho.
