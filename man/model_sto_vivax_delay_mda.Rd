\title{Reaction associated with the vivax model with delays and MDA during prophylaxis, in stochastic version}
\usage{
model_sto_vivax_delay_mda()
}
\value{
A list with 2 objects:
model: the stochastic model compiled (as in the TiPS package)
reactions_incidence: a list of vectors indicating which reactions correspond to the incidence variables hh and hhl
}
\description{
This function creates the stochastic model for vivax dynamics with delays to treatment and MDA.
