# VivaxModelR

Simulations and calculations on a compartmental model for Plasmodium Vivax dynamics.

This code is associated with the following manuscript:  
Champagne C., Gerhards M. , Lana J., García Espinosa B., Bradley C., González O., Cohen J.,Le Menach A., White M., Pothin E.  **"Using observed incidence to calibrate the transmission level of a mathematical model for Plasmodium vivax dynamics including case management and importation"** 

The package can be installed using the devtools package:  

```{r}
library(devtools)  
install_github("SwissTPH/VivaxModelR")  
```

The scripts necessary to reproduce the manuscript figures are situated under demo/figures_UsingObservedIncidence.
